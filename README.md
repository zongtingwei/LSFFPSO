# LSFFPSO
### Abstract:
The large-scale feature fixation (LSFF) used for particle swarm optimization (PSO) may easily trapped in local optima. Therefore, this study proposed a new method for initializing the search directions and selecting features, while eliminating the Special Unitary (SU) strategy, in order to enhance the performance of the LSFF framework.

### To run experiments:
Several datasets are also provided in the file of datasets.
### Notice:
