# LSFFPSO
### Abstract:
Reference: Yang, Jia-Quan, et al. "Bi-directional feature fixation-based particle swarm optimization for large-scale feature selection." IEEE Transactions on Big Data 9.3 (2022): 1004-1017.

The large-scale feature fixation (LSFF) used for particle swarm optimization (PSO) may easily trapped in local optima. Therefore, this study proposed a new method for initializing the search directions and selecting features, while eliminating the Special Unitary (SU) strategy, in order to enhance the performance of the LSFF framework.

### To run experiments:
Several datasets are also provided in the file of datasets.
### Notice:
If you use the datasets in your research, pleace cite the authors' articles. The detail information can be finded in the websites: [https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/index.html] and [https://ckzixf.github.io/dataset.html].
